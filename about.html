    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>LLB Graduate & Front-end developer from Johannesburg, South Africa</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p>
        I hold an LLB from the University of the Free State and am eager to embark on a fulfilling legal career. 
        With a passion for professional growth and a strong work ethic, 
        I have refined my skills in client communication, legal research, 
        and advocacy through roles at the UFS Law Clinic and Engo Child & Youth Care.
        <br />
        <br />
        My experiences have equipped me to excel independently and within teams, 
        making positive contributions to any legal organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my legal pursuits, I am also passionate about front-end development, 
        with proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, API integration and netlify.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have dedicated time to learning these technologies 
        and have successfully completed several projects showcasing my skills. 
        With a commitment to professional growth and a strong work ethic, 
        I am equipped to excel both in the legal field and in front-end development.
